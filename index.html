                      Konektid believes successful design and implementation of a global business
                      strategy requires a thorough understanding of local market needs and strong,
                      collaborative relationships with key local stakeholders. Konektid ensures our
                      clients’ global business strategy integrates these essential elements and that
                      every step of our work is informed by trusted local perspective from
                      Konektid’s global on-the-ground network.

                    <p class="large text-muted">
                      A strong global business strategy should include partnerships with governments
                      and international banks to mitigate market risks, through leveraged financing
                      and local brand management. Konektid’s team has decades of experience
                      designing and managing more than $1 billion dollars of government-funded
                      investment in global markets. This uniquely positions Konektid as a trusted
                      broker and seasoned implementer of these partnerships.

                                      dedicate to clearly understanding each partner’s needs and

                    <strong>Our story</strong><br>
                    During the decade Mike Shanley spent working in international aid, he saw a disconnect between
                    businesses growing in emerging markets and the governments and international development
                    organizations investing $150 billion a year in those same markets. In 2013, Mike founded Konektid to
                    bridge this gap and share the value of international aid investment with the private sector. He
                    began by consolidating his local network in 60 emerging markets, and building a team of private
                    sector and international development experts, with expertise across six continents in a variety of
                    industries. This idea quickly evolved into the global business strategy consulting firm that
                    Konektid is today.

                    In selecting Konektid (“connected”) as our name, we chose a phrase with a positive connotation
                    across the diverse countries we operate in. Konekti comes from the Esperanto language, created in
                    the 19th century to be a single language that bridges cultural and linguistic barriers. Konekti
                    connotes connections and partnerships. The “id” at the end of Konektid is from international
                    development, and represents the unique value Konektid provides to our clients by leveraging
                    international development resources through partnerships as a market entry tool.
